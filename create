 Steps to Create:
Create the HTML Structure:

Make a container for the girl.

Inside that, create separate div elements for the head, hair, eyes, mouth, body, arms, and legs.

Style with CSS:

Use width, height, and background-color to shape and color each part.

Use border-radius to make circular shapes like the head and eyes.

Use position: absolute to place body parts correctly on top of each other.

Add Animation:

Use @keyframes in CSS to animate movements like:
Blinking eyes by changing their height.

Waving arm by rotating it.

Apply animations using the animation property on the parts you want to move.

View in Browser:

Save the file with a .html extension.

Open it in any browser to see the animated girl.
